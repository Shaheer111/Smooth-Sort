Smooth Sort:
Smooth sort is a comparision based sorting algorithm.it is a variant of heap sort and it was invented and published by Edger Dijkstra in 1981 and it is not a stable sort
Our Program will work only on integer as well as String Input. It won't sort the Negative Values Given as input.
String Array is created in main function to take input from user.
Printing Array is also done in the Main Function.

Time complexity of smooth sort  is as following 
Best Case: O(n)
Worst Case: O(nlogn)
